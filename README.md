# DungeonBot

A small Slack bot API written in Python for a D&D campaign, which we named
**\`import campaign\`** because we're Python nerds.


## About

DungeonBot uses Slack's [Events API](https://api.slack.com/events) to listen
for posts in channels and then acts upon them if appropriate using the
[slacker](https://github.com/os/slacker) Python library. Interaction is
primarily done through !-commands, with a few exceptions.
